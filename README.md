# iSprinkle

## Warning: still under development and may or may not be a working build.

iSprinkle is an IoT sprinkler controller for the Raspberry Pi made using Bootstrap, Angular, and Flask. It's a web application that is hosted on the RPi itself and aims to reduce water usage by fetching the latest weather forecast and adjusting the user's set schedule using a ratio of the past weekly temperature and their desired watering duration.

Features:
- Dashboard with watering usage graph
- Advanced schedule
- Manual station activation
- Administration page with uptime and local IP
